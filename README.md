# Finish-your-Tasks


This is a basic to-do list application, which when you can check whether you completed a specific task or not. If you have not completed then, you can remind yourselves that you have a pending task that needs to completed by the end of the day. If you have completed then kudos for completing and the task will marked as completed. And by seeing the finished tasks you will get a dopamine high and will motivate yourself for completing the other tasks too. 

The application is built using swift UI, UIkit and swift programming language.
